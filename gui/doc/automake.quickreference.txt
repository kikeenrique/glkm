All predefined macros should be found under /usr/share/aclocal* directory.
With a simple grep MACRO /usr/share/aclocal*/* you should locate any macro avaliable in your development machine.

################################################################################

** AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([OPTIONS...])
			Initialize Automake. 
			Check for tools needed by ‘automake’-generated Makefiles.
			Useful options:
				-Wall		Turn all warnings on.
				-Werror		Report warnings as errors.
				foreign		Relax some GNU standard requirements.
				1.9.6		Require a minimum version of ‘automake’.
				dist-bzip2	Also create tar.bz2 archives during ‘make dist’ and ‘make distcheck’.
				tar-ustar		Create tar archives using the ustar format.

** AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h) 
 	DEPRECATED for AC_CONFIG_HEADERS 
	see  -> http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Optional.html#Optional
	-		Header file which will hold the preprocessor macro definitions at run time.
	-		Your sources would then use `#include "config.h"' to include it.
	-		This macro may optionally name the input file for that header file; by default, this is `config.h.in', but that file name
 	-		works poorly on DOS filesystems. Therefore, it is often better to name it explicitly as `config.in'. This is what you
	-		 should normally put in `configure.in':
	-			AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h:config.in)
	-		(If you are not using automake, use `AC_CONFIG_HEADER' rather than `AM_CONFIG_HEADER'). 

** AM_MAINTAINER_MODE
			`--enable-maintainer-mode' option is required to enable automatic rebuilding of generated files used 
			by the configure system. This of course requires that developers be aware of, and use, that option. 
			If this macro is not used, then the generated files will always be rebuilt automatically. 
			This will cause problems if the wrong versions of autoconf, automake, or others are in the builder's `PATH'. 

** AM_PROG_LIBTOOL
			If you want to build libraries, and you want to permit them to be shared, or you want to link against 
			libraries which were built using libtool, then you will need this macro. This macro is required in order to use libtool.
			By default, this will cause all libraries to be built as shared libraries. 
			To prevent this use `AM_DISABLE_SHARED' before `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL'. 
			The configure options `--enable-shared' and `--disable-shared' may be used to override the default at build time.

** AM_GNU_GETTEXT
			This macro is required for packages which use GNU gettext (see gettext). It is distributed with gettext. 
			If Automake sees this macro it ensures that the package meets some of gettext's requirements.
