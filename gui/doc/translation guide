Translations live in the po directory in .po files. These text files are compiled into binary .mo or .gmo files at compile time. LSR developers have little to do to enable this process except maintain two files in the po folder:

POTFILES.in
    Lists file names relative to the project root containing strings to be translated 
POTFILES.skip
    Lists file names relative to the project root that should never be translated, even if the contain strings marked for translation 

To generate a list of source files containing strings marked for translation but missing from POTFILES.in:

intltool-update --maintain

To generate the .pot file template for translators:

intltool-update --pot

To generate a report of the current translations:

intltool-update --report
